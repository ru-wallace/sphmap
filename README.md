## Purpose

Google maps doesn't do what I want when I ask it how to get somewhere by transit. It seems to think I can't walk 4 blocks, and that busses will always come according to schedule. A missed transfer or leaving a couple minutes late can double the length of a trip. Lets make our own path planner that is heavily configurable to the point where I can always get a path I like. Maybe some days I don't want to walk uphill, maybe I don't like walking through certain areas at night, maybe I prefer to walk down sidestreets with less cars, etc.
